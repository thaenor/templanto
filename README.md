# Templanto

# Project discontinued... 

## The name

Comes from Template and Esperanto, because this is meant to be a universal tool for translations.

## folder structure

The folder "OLD" contains an old solution built in bare-bones electron, it works but I think I didn't connect it with the terminal tool

The folder "my-new-app" contains the actual "working" solution

## The core

it uses mustache template engine to render templates based off of an excel file with specific formatting.

Inside the running app, there's a tutorial on how it works.

## To start running the app

* clone the repo
* `cd` into the project folder (my-new-app) and `npm install`
* `npm run` will show the available commands and `npm start` kickstarts the app

PS: when this is packaged running the app will be a lot smoother.
